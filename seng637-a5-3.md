## RDC Plots

The failure data had to be modified before plotting. As the data was given as failures per interval, not time between failures. This was done by assuming failures were uniformly distributed in each interval. For example, if given data is:

| T |FC|
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |

Then it would be converted into time between failures as follows. At T=1, there are two failures, it can be assumed that one failure is at T=0.5 and the other is at T=1.

| Cumulative Failure Count | Time Between Failures | Cumulative Time |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0.5  | 0.5  |
| 2 | 0.5  | 1    |
| 3 | 0.33 | 1.33 |
| 4 | 0.33 | 1.67 |
| 5 | 0.33 | 2    |

## MTTF200

The first plot below shows the RDC graph using the calculated MTTF of the SUT, FIO = 200 failures/31 intervals = 6.452, giving MTTF = 1/6.452 = 0.155

## MTTF375

The second plot It was determined the FIO was 375/31 = 12.097 failures per interval. Giving a MTTF of 0.083.

## MTTF500

500/31 = 16.129. MTTF = 0.062
