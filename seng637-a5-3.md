## RDC Plots

The failure data had to be modified before plotting. As the data was given as failures per interval, not time between failures. This was done by assuming failures were uniformly distributed in each interval. For example, if given data is:

| T |FC|
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |

Then it would be converted into time between failures as follows. At T=1, there are two failures, it can be assumed that one failure is at T=0.5 and the other is at T=1.

| Cumulative Failure Count | Time Between Failures | Cumulative Time |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0.5  | 0.5  |
| 2 | 0.5  | 1    |
| 3 | 0.33 | 1.33 |
| 4 | 0.33 | 1.67 |
| 5 | 0.33 | 2    |

### 1 The first plot below shows the RDC graph using the calculated MTTF of the SUT, FIO = 200 failures/31 intervals = 6.452, giving MTTF = 1/6.452 = 0.155

### 2. In the second plot it was determined that the FIO was 375/31 = 12.097 failures per interval. Giving a MTTF of 0.083.We can continue tests to determine when the system will reach an acceptable condition.

### 3. Here, we determined with an FIO of 500/31 = 16.129 and an MTTF = 0.062 that we are in the acceptable region.

### 4. If we take double the MTTF value and have a FIO value of 1000/31 = 32.258 we are completely in the acceptable region.
