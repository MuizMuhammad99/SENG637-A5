# Introduction
This assignment has enhanced our understanding about integrating test data using reliability assessment tools. The first part of this lab includes Reliability growth testing by which we gained hands-on experience on assessing the reliability of a hypothetical system. Here we had to perform Reliability growth testing using Software Reliability and Testing Analysis Tool( SRTAT) on the given set of failure data. At the end of this test we were able to measure the failure rate, MTTF and reliability of the SUT through analyzing the test data.

The second part of this lab consisted of Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart(RDC). This part focuses on identify the target MTTF, plotting the failure points in RDC and analysing the trend. Further different MTTF values were set to test if the SUT is acceptable by observing the plot.


# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

## RDC Plots

The given failure data had to be modified before plotting. As the data was given as failures per interval, not time between failures. This was done by assuming failures were uniformly distributed in each interval. For example, if given data is:

| T |FC|
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 |

Then it would be converted into time between failures and further converted to cumulative time as follows. At T=1, there are two failures, it can be assumed that one failure is at T=0.5 and the other is at T=1.  At T=2, there are three failures, it can be assumed that one failure is at T=1.33, second failure at T=1.67 and the last failure at T=2.

| Cumulative Failure Count | Time Between Failures | Cumulative Time |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0.5  | 0.5  |
| 2 | 0.5  | 1    |
| 3 | 0.33 | 1.33 |
| 4 | 0.33 | 1.67 |
| 5 | 0.33 | 2    |


* The first plot below shows the RDC graph using the calculated MTTF of the SUT, FIO = 200 failures/31 intervals = 6.452, giving MTTF = 1/6.452 = 0.155

* In the second plot it was determined that the FIO was 375/31 = 12.097 failures per interval. Giving a MTTF of 0.083. We can continue tests to determine when the system will reach an acceptable condition.

* Here, we determined with an FIO of 500/31 = 16.129 and an MTTF = 0.062 that we are in the acceptable region.

* If we take double the MTTF value and have a FIO value of 1000/31 = 32.258 we are completely in the acceptable region.

What we...

- **Liked:** 
- **Disliked:** 
- **Found Interesting:** It was interesting to observe that as the MTTF decreased, the failure data points approached the acceptance threshold for failure intensity.
- **Found Confusing:** 
- **Found Challenging:** The biggest challenge was to understand the given formulas in RDC tool.
- **Found Motivating:**
